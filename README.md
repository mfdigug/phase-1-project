This is my read me file for my pokedex card app

When this page loads using the PokeAPI for data, the user should get a welcome message and see a list of existing pokemon (first 151) in the database.

The user should be able to view more detailed information about each pokemon by either:
- clicking on a pokemon name in the left hand side list (click event) OR
- pressing the up or down arrow keys (keydown event) to navigate through pokemon list 
Either action should reveal more information about the pokemon including its type, stats, attacks and an image.

The user can filter the list of pokemon by type by selecting a type from the drop down menu (change event) in the nav bar. The user can reset the list by clicking 'all'
